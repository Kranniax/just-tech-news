# Just-Tech-News

## Description

Just Tech News â€” a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. I used Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify my MySQL queries, add password hashing so that users can create secure passwords, and connected my application to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js.

## Installation

### Node installation on Windows

Please visit [Official Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

To install all node modules and dependencies, please run the command. `npm install`
